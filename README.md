## What is this?

### Kennel Club

- Kennel Club UK (KCUK) is the UK's largest organisation devoted to dog health, welfare and training.
- Has public data of the lineage of dogs across multiple breeds, going back decades.
- [https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/](https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/)

### This repo

- When searching for a particular dog, KCUK limits what you can see in terms of the pedigree for each dog, making exploring the full lineage somewhat tricky.
- For example, asking "Why is my dog yellow when his parents are black?" requires you to explore the ancestry and might require going back multiple generations, which requires a lot of manual trial and error.
- **This project scrapes and collects all the data for a dog's lineage, visualises it in one place and improves the experience of exploring a dog's lineage.**

## Build and run

### Install dependencies

```shell script
pipenv install --dev
```

### Run

With scraper:

```shell script
# Defaults to my dog
pipenv run python get_full_pedigree.py 
```

Without scraping (loads data locally:)

```shell script
pipenv run python get_full_pedigree.py --noscrape
```

With a specific dogId:

```shell script
pipenv run python get_full_pedigree.py --start d020bc10-e67b-e911-a8a8-002248005556
```

### d3.js

```shell script
cd d3

# Python3
python -m http.server 8088

# Python2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8088
```

Then navigate to your [localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088).
